            <h2>All About Me:</h2>
            <p >My name is CJ, which stands for Cool Jeans. I'm a university student who enjoys desserts (very specifically icecream). 
                I also like playing the daily sudoku and wordle. If I had to choose my favourite colour, it'd be red
                I attend the University of Toronto in Mississauga. I currently live with my Mum, brother, sister and dog. I have 4 wonderful best friends. 
                I strongly dislike audacious people. I love music. Currently I have been enjoying the song "We're just making it worse" by Cameron Avery and Alexandra Saviour.
                I'm in a few clubs at school, however my attendance is not frequent. I had cake for breakfast this morning.
